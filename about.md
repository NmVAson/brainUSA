## Choke - In - Choke

The "choke-in-choke" inner profile of BRAIN choke tubes is the biggest breakthrough in the history of chokes due to the enhanced periphery.

## How It Functions

BRAIN Chokes start with a tightening section before the expansion and this makes a very big difference! This first tightening section creates a dense core but, as the shot load passes through the expansion section gets more pellets from core to periphery and, because it enters the final tightening being at a phase of expanding, there is no more a dense core at the final pattern.
